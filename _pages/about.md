Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu) where I'm advised by [Prof. Serena Yeung-Levy](https://marvl.stanford.edu/people.html).

My research focuses on understanding human social interaction and behavior through computer vision. I develop 3D human mesh estimation and, more broadly, video understanding models, with a focus on applications in healthcare. My goal is to create scalable AI systems to analyze complex social dynamics, particularly those behind parent-child interactions.

Previously I obtained my M.Sc and B.Sc at [Universidad de los Andes](https://www.uniandes.edu.co/es) in Biomedical Engineering and worked on computer vision for surgical scene understanding under [Prof. Pablo Arbel√°ez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k0nZO90AAAAJ&hl=es).
